## Description

If you're a fan of the Nintendo game Animal Crossing, then this is the app for you! As you may have noticed in-game, Villagers are one of the most important aspects of Animal Crossing, making a somewhat lonely game feel super interactive! These Villagers are more than just NPCs! They are unique and taking time to research their different aspects could take away from the fun. Our app makes that easy!

This application was created for UC Berkeley Bootcamp and solves real-world problems by integrating data received using the MVC paradigm and server-side APIs. The website was built collaboratively using Visual Studio Code and deployed to Heroku. The website is designed to allow a user to sign up and sign in, search and view favorite villagers from the online game Animal Crossing, and save them to a favorites list. Once the user searches a character or villager, they will appear on the main page displaying their name, photo, species, personality, hobby, birthday, catchphrase, favorite song, and favorite saying, all data received through the animal-crossing npm. 
 
**Villagers 101** is a user friendly application that consists of a top navbar for direction and a footer for connection. Multiple coding pages are used such as index.html, style.css and app.js. Materialize is the CSS framework used to style the web page. The hope of this web application is to provide a fun and interactive search engine tool that is simple to navigate.
